# Website for film "Dordrecht door de jaren heen"

Angular project for the film "Dordrecht door de jaren heen". Makes use of GitHub pages and CloudFlare for hosting. Why not, right? Seems like a pragmatic choice to us.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
